## SIP Load Balancer in Go

To implement a SIP load balancer in Go that keeps track of the current number of connections for each backend connecting to it, you can use a round-robin algorithm based on the current load of the backends. You can check the number of active connections to each SIP service in Kubernetes to determine the load of each backend.

One approach to implementing this SIP load balancer is to use MetalLB, a load balancer that is designed to work with Kubernetes[1]. You can integrate MetalLB with your existing network equipment as it supports BGP and also layer 2 configuration. MetalLB allows you to use the `LoadBalancer` type when you declare a service, which will allocate an external IP to the service and distribute the traffic to the backends based on the chosen load balancing algorithm.

To keep track of the number of connections to each backend, you can use the `go-conntrack` middleware for `net.Conn` tracking. This middleware provides Go tracing and monitoring (Prometheus) for `net.Conn` and supports both inbound `net.Listener` and outbound `net.Dialer` [2]. You can use this middleware to track the number of active connections to each SIP service in Kubernetes and distribute the traffic to the least loaded backend.

Another approach is to use a SIP proxy, such as OpenSER, OpenSIPS, or Kamailio, which can do load balancing, failover, and other features between the Asterisk servers[3]. These SIP proxies can be configured to use a round-robin algorithm to distribute traffic to the backends based on their current load.

In summary, to implement a SIP load balancer in Go that keeps track of the current number of connections for each backend connecting to it, you can use MetalLB to allocate an external IP to the service and distribute the traffic based on the chosen load balancing algorithm. You can also use the `go-conntrack` middleware to track the number of active connections to each SIP service in Kubernetes and distribute the traffic to the least loaded backend. Alternatively, you can use a SIP proxy to distribute the traffic to the backends based on their current load[1][2][3].
